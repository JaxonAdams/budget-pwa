## Description
This app is a conversion of an existing app (provided by the University of Utah) into a progressive web application. It can be downloaded, works offline, and sends notifications when appropriate. It uses an Express.js server with MongoDB and Mongoose. You can visit the website [here](https://desolate-river-93402.herokuapp.com/index.html).
    


## Usage
If you would like to test notifications, please allow notifications when you visit the site. You will be notified when your transaction is sent to the server.
